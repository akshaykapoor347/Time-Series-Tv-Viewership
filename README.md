# Time-Series-Tv-Viewership
This project is about timeseries and forecasting. We implement exponential smoothing on real TV viewership data to predict the future values of viewers. We have the data from January 2014 to December 2017 which we separate into test and training set. We train our model from January to 2014 to December 2016 and test our model on 2017 data. We then check the accuracy of our model using mean absolute error between real and predicted values.

Details about this is posted in the TvViewerShip Timeseries document file.
